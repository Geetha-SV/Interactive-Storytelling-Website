            <p class="slide-in delayed">As you walk deeper into the forest, the trees become taller and the light dimmer. Eventually, you stumble upon a magical clearing bathed in soft, ethereal light. In the center of the clearing, a large stone marked with ancient runes catches
                your eye. Using the key, you unlock the stone, revealing the treasure hidden beneath. The treasure includes a powerful staff, a book of spells, and a cloak of invisibility. With these newfound magical artifacts, you become a powerful wizard,
                mastering the arcane arts and protecting the realm from dark forces.
